# Motherboards, Processors, and Memory
<hr>
##### Understanding Motherboards

-> The spine of the computer is the *motherboard* also known as the *system board* or the *mainboard*.
-> This is the *Printed Circuit Board (PCB)* which is a conductive series of pathways, laminated to a non-conductive substrate that lines the bottom of the computer.
-> It is often of a uniform color such as: *green, brown, blue, black* or *red.* 
-> It is the most important part of a computer because it connects all the other components together.


##### What will you find on the System Board?
| Item name | |
|---|---|
| CPU (Central Processing Unit) or CPU slot | | 
| Underlying Circuitry | |
| Expansion Slots ||
| Video components ||
| Random Accesss Memory (RAM slots) ||
| A variety of other chips ||


##### Motherboard Form Factors

-> System Boards are classified by their *form factor* (design) such as *ATX & ITX*
-> Exercise care when purchasing motherboards and components seperately.
-> Motherboards will have different expansion slots, support certain processors and memory and fit into some cases but not others.
-> Be sure that the parts are physically compatible with the motherboard you choose


##### Advanced Technology eXtended

-> Intel developed the *Advanced Technology eXtended (ATX)* motherboard in the mid 1990s to improve upon the classic AT-style motherboard architecture that had ruled the PC world for many years.
-> The ATX motherboard has the processor and memory slots at right angles to the expansion cards.
-> This arrangement puts the processor and memory in line with the fan output and the power supply, allowing the processor to run cooler.
-> Because those components are not in line with the expansion cards, you can install full-length expansion cards - adapters that extend the full length of the inside of a standard computer case - in an ATX motherboard machine.
-> ATX (and it's derivatives such as micro-ATX) is the primary PC Motherboard form factor in use today.
-> Standard ATX motherboards measure 12"x9.6" (305mm x 244mm)


##### Information Technology eXtended
-> The *Information Technology eXtended (ITX)* line of motherboard form factors was developed by VIA technologies in the early 2000s as a low power small form factor (SFF) board for specialty uses, including home theater systems, compact desktop systems, gaming systems and embedded components.
-> ITX itself is not a form factor, but it is a family of form factors.
-> The family consists of the following form factors:

| Form Factor | Size (IN) | Size (MM) | 
|---|---|---|
| Mini ITX | 6.7" x 6.7" | 170mm x 170mm |
| Nano ITX | 4.7" x 4.7" | 120mm x 120mm |
| Pico ITX | 3.9" x 2.8" | 100mm x 72mm |
| Mobile ITX | 2.4" x 2.4" | 60mm x 60mm |

-> The Mini ITX motherboard has four mounting holes that line up with three or four of the holes in the ATX and micro ATX form factors.
-> In Mini ITX boards, the rear interfaces are placed on the same location as those on the ATX motherboards.
-> These features make the Mini ITX boards compatible with ATX cases.
-> This is where the mounting compatibility ends, because despite the compatibility of other ITX form factors, they are used in embedded systems such as, set-top boxes, home entertainment systems and smartphones and lack the requisite mounting and interface specifications.
